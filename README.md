# elements-with-node

### This is a learning experience - building own node.js application from scratch using express and mongodb.

The **drawings branch** is a switch from any picture to children drawings archive specifically. User can login and add a scan/photo with date drawn and description. Tag it with child's name. Search and sort. Favourite. Remove the drawing.
Comments section not that useful but left unchanged.
Switched back to light theme.
Switched to polish language because of grandmas.

### DRAWINGS TODO
- [ ] add admin role
- [x] change schemas to accomodate new features
